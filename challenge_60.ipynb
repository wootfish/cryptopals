    "Explicit-Formulas Database (https://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/), the\n",
    "one-stop shop for state-of-the-art ECC implementation techniques. It's\n",
    "like cheat codes for elliptic curves. Worth visiting for the\n",
    "bibliography alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, we should try to demystify this a little bit. Here's\n",
    "the CliffsNotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Points on a Montgomery curve are (u, v) pairs, but this function\n",
    "   only takes u as an input. Given *just* the u coordinate of a point\n",
    "   P, this function computes *just* the u coordinate of k*P. Since we\n",
    "   only care about u, this is a single-coordinate ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. So what the heck is w? It's part of an alternate point\n",
    "   representation. Instead of a coordinate u, we have a coordinate\n",
    "   u/w. Think of it as a way to defer expensive division (read:\n",
    "   inversion) operations until the very end.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. cswap is a function that swaps its first two arguments (or not)\n",
    "   depending on whether its third argument is one or zero. Choosy\n",
    "   implementers choose arithmetic implementations of cswap, not\n",
    "   branching ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The core of the inner loop is a differential addition followed by a\n",
    "   doubling operation. Differential addition means we can add two\n",
    "   points P and Q only if we already know P - Q. We'll take this\n",
    "   difference to be the input u and maintain it as an invariant\n",
    "   throughout the ladder. Indeed, our two initial points are:\n",
    "\n",
    "       u2, w2 := (1, 0)\n",
    "       u3, w3 := (u, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Representing the identity and the input u.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The return statement performs the modular inversion using a trick\n",
    "   due to Fermat's Little Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "       a^p     = a    mod p\n",
    "       a^(p-1) = 1    mod p\n",
    "       a^(p-2) = a^-1 mod p\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A consequence of the Montgomery ladder is that we conflate (u, v)\n",
    "   and (u, -v). But this encoding also conflates zero and\n",
    "   infinity. Both are represented as zero. Note that the usual\n",
    "   exceptional case where w = 0 is handled gracefully: our trick for\n",
    "   doing the inversion with exponentiation outputs zero as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is fine: we're still working in a subgroup of prime order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and implement the ladder. Remember that all computations are\n",
    "in GF(233970423115425145524320034830162017933).\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh yeah, the curve parameters. You might be thinking that since we're\n",
    "switching to a new curve format, we also need to pick out a whole new\n",
    "curve. But you'd be totally wrong! It turns out that some short\n",
    "Weierstrass curves can be converted into Montgomery curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because all finite cyclic groups with an equal number of\n",
    "elements share a kind of equivalence we call \"isomorphism\". It makes\n",
    "sense, if you think about it - if the order is the same, all the same\n",
    "subgroups will be present, and in the same proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all we need to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a Montgomery curve with an equal order to our curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Figure out how to map points back and forth between curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform this conversion algebraically. But it's kind of a\n",
    "pain, so here you go:\n",
    "\n",
    "    v^2 = u^3 + 534*u^2 + u\n",
    "\n",
    "Through cunning and foresight, I have chosen this curve specifically\n",
    "to have a really simple map between Weierstrass and Montgomery\n",
    "forms. Here it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    u = x - 178\n",
    "    v = y\n",
    "\n",
    "Which makes our base point:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (4, 85518893674295321206118380980485522083)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you know. Just 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, implement the ladder. Verify ladder(4, n) = 0. Map some points\n",
    "back and forth between your Weierstrass and Montgomery representations\n",
    "and verify them.\n",
