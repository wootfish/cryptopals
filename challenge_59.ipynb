    "59. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman and Invalid-Curve Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not going to show you any graphs - if you want to see one, you can\n",
    "find them in, like, every other elliptic curve tutorial on the\n",
    "internet. Personally, I've never been able to gain much insight from\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're also really hard to draw in ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to understand about elliptic curves is that they're a\n",
    "setting analogous in many ways to one we're more familiar with, the\n",
    "multiplicative integers mod p. So if we learn how certain primitive\n",
    "operations are defined, we can reason about them using a lot of tools\n",
    "we already have in our utility belts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig in. An elliptic curve E is just an equation like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the a and b coefficients defines the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the notation GF(p) to talk about a finite field of size\n",
    "p. (The \"GF\" is for \"Galois field\", another name for a finite field.)\n",
    "When we take a curve E over field GF(p) (written E(GF(p))), what we're\n",
    "saying is that only points with both x and y in GF(p) are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, (3, 6) might be a valid point in E(GF(7)), but it\n",
    "wouldn't be a valid point in E(GF(5)); 6 is not a member of GF(5).\n",
    "\n",
    "(3, 4.7) wouldn't be a valid point on either curve, since 4.7 is not\n",
    "an integer and thus not a member of either field.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about (3, -1)? This one is on the curve, but remember we're in\n",
    "some GF(p). So in GF(7), -1 is actually 6. That means (3, -1) and (3,\n",
    "6) are the same point. In GF(5), -1 is 4, so blah blah blah you get\n",
    "what I'm saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay: if these points are going to form a group analogous to the\n",
    "multiplicative integers mod p, we need to have an analogous set of\n",
    "primitive functions to work with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the multiplicative integers mod p, we combined two elements by\n",
    "   multiplying them together and taking the remainder modulo p.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We combine elliptic curve points by adding them. We'll talk about\n",
    "   what that means in a hot second.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We used 1 as a multiplicative identity: y * 1 = y for all y.\n",
    "\n",
    "   On an elliptic curve, we define the identity O as an abstract\n",
    "   \"point at infinity\" that doesn't map to any actual (x, y)\n",
    "   pair. This might feel like a bit of a hack, but it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "   On the curve, we have the straightforward rule that P + O = P for\n",
    "   all P.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In your code, you can just write something like O := object(),\n",
    "   since it only ever gets used in pointer comparisons. Or you can use\n",
    "   some sentinel coordinate that doesn't satisfy the curve equation;\n",
    "   (0, 1) is popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We had a modinv function to invert an integer mod p. This acted as\n",
    "   a stand-in for division. Given y, it finds x such that y * x = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Inversion is way easier in elliptic curves. Just flip the sign on\n",
    "   y, and remember that we're in GF(p):\n",
    "\n",
    "       invert((x, y)) = (x, -y) = (x, p-y)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Just like with multiplicative inverses, we have this rule on\n",
    "   elliptic curves:\n",
    "\n",
    "       P + (-P) = P + invert(P) = O\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, these primitives, along with a finite set of elements,\n",
    "are all we need to define a finite cyclic group, which is all we need\n",
    "to define the Diffie-Hellman function. Not important to understand the\n",
    "abstract jargon, just FYI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about addition. Here it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    function add(P1, P2):\n",
    "        if P1 = O:\n",
    "            return P2\n",
    "\n",
    "        if P2 = O:\n",
    "            return P1\n",
    "\n",
    "        if P1 = invert(P2):\n",
    "            return O\n",
    "\n",
    "        x1, y1 := P1\n",
    "        x2, y2 := P2\n",
    "\n",
    "        if P1 = P2:\n",
    "            m := (3*x1^2 + a) / 2*y1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            m := (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n",
    "\n",
    "        x3 := m^2 - x1 - x2\n",
    "        y3 := m*(x1 - x3) - y1\n",
    "\n",
    "        return (x3, y3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three checks are simple - they pretty much just implement\n",
    "the rules we have for the identity and inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we, uh, use math. You can read more about that part\n",
    "elsewhere, if you're interested. It's not too important to us, but it\n",
    "(sort of) makes sense in the context of those graphs I'm not showing\n",
    "you.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more thing we need. In the multiplicative integers, we\n",
    "expressed repeated multiplication as exponentiation, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y * y * y * y * y = y^5\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented this using a modexp function that walked the bits of\n",
    "the exponent with a square-and-multiply inner loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "On elliptic curves, we'll use scalar multiplication to express\n",
    "repeated addition, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P + P + P + P + P = 5*P\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't be confused by the shared notation: scalar multiplication is not\n",
    "analogous to multiplication in the integers. It's analogous to\n",
    "exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your scalarmult function will look pretty much exactly the same as\n",
    "your modexp function, except with the primitives swapped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, you wanna hear something great? You could define a generic\n",
    "scale function parameterized over a group that works as a drop-in\n",
    "implementation for both. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    function scale(x, k):\n",
    "        result := identity\n",
    "        while k > 0:\n",

    "            k := k >> 1\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "\n",
    "The combine function would delegate to modular multiplication or\n",
    "elliptic curve point depending on the group. It's kind of like the\n",
    "definition of a group constitutes a kind of interface, and we have\n",
    "these two different implementations we can swap out freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this metaphor, here's a generic Diffie-Hellman:\n",
    "\n",
    "    function generate_keypair():\n",
    "        secret := random(1, baseorder)\n",
    "        public := scale(base, secret)\n",

    "    function compute_secret(peer_public, self_secret):\n",
    "        return scale(peer_public, self_secret)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity itself! The base and baseorder attributes map to g and q in\n",
    "the multiplicative integer setting. It's pretty much the same on a\n",
    "curve: we'll have a base point G and its order n such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    n*G = O\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that these two settings share so many similarities (and can\n",
    "even share a naive implementation) is great news. It means we already\n",
    "have a lot of the tools we need to reason about (and attack) elliptic\n",
