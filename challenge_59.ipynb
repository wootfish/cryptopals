    "> We'll use the notation GF(p) to talk about a finite field of size p. (The \"GF\" is for \"Galois field\", another name for a finite field.) When we take a curve E over field GF(p) (written E(GF(p))), what we're saying is that only points with both x and y in GF(p) are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, (3, 6) might be a valid point in E(GF(7)), but it wouldn't be a valid point in E(GF(5)); 6 is not a member of GF(5).\n",

    "> We combine elliptic curve points by adding them.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Inversion is way easier in elliptic curves. Just flip the sign on y, and remember that we're in GF(p): invert((x, y)) = (x, -y) = (x, p-y)\n",
