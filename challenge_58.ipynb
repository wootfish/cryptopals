    "58. Pollard's Method for Catching Kangaroos\n",
    "\n",
    "The last problem was a little contrived. It only worked because I\n",
    "helpfully foisted those broken group parameters on Alice and\n",
    "Bob. While real-world groups may include some small subgroups, it's\n",
    "improbable to find this many in a randomly generated group.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what if we can only recover some fraction of the Bob's secret key?\n",
    "It feels like there should be some way to use that knowledge to\n",
    "recover the rest. And there is: Pollard's kangaroo algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a generic attack for computing a discrete logarithm (or\n",
    "\"index\") known to lie within a certain contiguous range [a, b]. It has\n",
    "a work factor approximately the square root of the size of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic strategy is to try to find a collision between two\n",
    "pseudorandom sequences of elements. One will start from an element of\n",
    "known index, and the other will start from the element y whose index\n",
    "we want to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand how these sequences are\n",
    "generated. Basically, we just define some function f mapping group\n",
    "elements (like the generator g, or a public key y) to scalars (a\n",
    "secret exponent, like x), i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f(y) = <some x>\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about how f is implemented for now. Just know that it's a\n",
    "function mapping where we are (some y) to the next jump we're going to\n",
    "take (some x). And it's deterministic: for a given y, it should always\n",
    "return the same x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we do a loop like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y := y * g^f(y)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing here is that the next step we take is a function whose\n",
    "sole input is the current element. This means that if our two\n",
    "sequences ever happen to visit the same element y, they'll proceed in\n",
    "lockstep from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's get a bit more specific. I mentioned we're going to\n",
    "generate two sequences this way. The first is our control\n",
    "sequence. This is the tame kangaroo in Pollard's example. We do\n",
    "something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    xT := 0\n",
    "    yT := g^b\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in 1..N:\n",
    "        xT := xT + f(yT)\n",
    "        yT := yT * g^f(yT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that b is the upper bound on the index of y. So we're starting\n",
    "the tame kangaroo's run at the very end of that range. Then we just\n",
    "take N leaps and accumulate our total distance traveled in xT. At the\n",
    "end of the loop, yT = g^(b + xT). This will be important later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this algorithm doesn't require us to build a big look-up\n",
    "table a la Shanks' baby-step giant-step, so its space complexity is\n",
    "constant. That's kinda neat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now: let's catch that wild kangaroo. We'll do a similar loop, this\n",
    "time starting from y. Our hope is that at some point we'll collide\n",
    "with the tame kangaroo's path. If we do, we'll eventually end up at\n",
    "the same place. So on each iteration, we'll check if we're there.\n",
    "\n",
    "    xW := 0\n",
    "    yW := y\n",
    "\n",
    "    while xW < b - a + xT:\n",
    "        xW := xW + f(yW)\n",
    "        yW := yW * g^f(yW)\n",
    "\n",
    "        if yW = yT:\n",
    "            return b + xT - xW\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to puzzle out the loop condition. What that relation is\n",
    "checking is whether we've gone past yT and missed it. In other words,\n",
    "that we didn't collide. This is a probabilistic algorithm, so it's not\n",
    "guaranteed to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure also that you understand the return statement. If you think\n",
    "through how we came to the final values for yW and yT, it should be\n",
    "clear that this value is the index of the input y.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple implementation details we've glossed over -\n",
    "specifically the function f and the iteration count N. I do something\n",
    "like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f(y) = 2^(y mod k)\n",
    "\n",
    "For some k, which you can play around with. Making k bigger will allow\n",
    "you to take bigger leaps in each loop iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "N is then derived from f - take the mean of all possible outputs of f\n",
    "and multiply it by a small constant, e.g. 4. You can make the constant\n",
    "bigger to better your chances of finding a collision at the (obvious)\n",
    "cost of extra computation. The reason N needs to depend on f is that f\n",
    "governs the size of the jumps we can make. If the jumps are bigger, we\n",
    "need a bigger runway to land on, or else we risk leaping past it.\n",
